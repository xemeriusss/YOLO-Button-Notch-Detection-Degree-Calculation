# YOLO-Button-Notch-Detection-Degree-Calculation
This project develops an AI-based object detection system specifically for the buttons on ovens. The primary goal is to create an intelligent tool that can identify the presence and orientation of buttons on ovens during production, thereby reducing the need for human intervention.
